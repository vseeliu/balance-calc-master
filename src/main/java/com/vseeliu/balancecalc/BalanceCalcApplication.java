/**
 * This is a microservice for real-time balance calculation, which provides two methods: synchronous calculation and
 * asynchronous calculation. Both have specific retry functions. The synchronous calculation has simple three-time
 * retries, and the asynchronous calculation uses message queues for retries. Both use distributed locks and Amazon
 * ElastiCache high-speed cache, providing higher performance and throughput. Due to time constraints, the locks,
 * exceptions, internationalization, data validation, etc. will be optimized subsequently.
